## Conflict Plan
- If there is a conflict between members, then we will bring the other members of the team to resolve the conflict. 
- We will always try to divide the work evenly, if someone is taking over we will remind them friendly that it is a group project. 
- If the team memebr is inadequately contributing we will use the Asana reminder that the task hasn't been complete yet first, and if thetask still hasn't been completed we will remind them by Slack. 
- Since we have deadline coming for the project we will use our team members strength for the project, and help the team member on the subject they want to learn.

## Communication Plan
- We are available to communicate throughout the day, though most of us have daytime job, our response is expected in few hours. If we need TA's help before 6:30pm then we will communicate with Sarah if she's available to work the problem with the TAs.
